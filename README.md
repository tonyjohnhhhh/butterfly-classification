# butterfly-classification
This model is based on resnet50, also it used CBAM, an attention module.\
So that this model is similar to fc-resnet which can be found on the Internet.\
And the data augmentation here we use is cutmix.\
The final improvement we use is TTA, Test-Time Augmentation.\
So the accuracy in the end is 0.93.\
The dataset I used is the dataset in Kaggle called butterfly classification.
